My flatmate managed to convert all of his favorite Weird Al cover art NFT's into some weird mess of files, and he will not stop BEGGING me to help him recover them. Please, if you can help me get them back, I'll give you a flag, anything to stop the repeated playing of Drive Thru that's blaring from his room at max volume on repeat.
