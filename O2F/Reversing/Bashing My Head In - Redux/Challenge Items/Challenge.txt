Hey, it's good to see you again! Maybe, I honestly can't remember if I've seen you before. Well anyway, a hacker was caught transfering data, but unfortunately they covered what data they were exfiltrating. However, we do have the encrypted data, the program they used to generate a secure password, and the bash history. Maybe you can help us out?
