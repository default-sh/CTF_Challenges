My friend was making breakfast and accidentally scrambled his JPEG! (He meant to make a sunny-side up)
Thankfully, he has photographic memory and remembers exactly how the JPEG got scrambled.
If you can unscramble his JPEG, he says he can give you a flag!

The instructions will be attached in a document.
